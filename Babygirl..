Beloved, Baby girl,

I need to confess something to you. Ever since I met you, I can only think of your mysterious, blue eyes. You filled my heart with unexpected joy and my head with amazing dreams of us together. My love can only grow more and more each day.

I dream of us Singing and from time to time I would gently stroke your blonde hair while you keep smiling. In moments like these my life would simply be complete.

When I’m alone in the quiet, it always feels like I can hear your voice, whispering me sweet nothings, just like the blessed music of a Guitar. I wanted to tell you this from a long time ago, you are as essential to me as is my Skirt.

My Fanciful Baby girl, please be insure I mean everything this love letter carries to you with all my heart. Once I saw your lovely eyes I knew there won’t be anything more precious to me in this whole world. I want to take you away from the ordinary, away from any upset or misfortune and we shall go together to Framce.

You are the best I ever had and I must be the luckiest person to have you in my life. You are my sunny day in winter. I’d give up all the Strawberry in the world to know that you will be right there beside me for the rest of our lives.

My heart skips a beat at the thought that soon I will bring you purple Star gazers to show you once more how dedicated I am to you, for all eternity.

Yours always and forever,
King Lucifer
